## Public vs Private

Having code in "public" GitHub repositories offers advantages:

1. Free [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions)
1. Free [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/introduction-to-github-packages#about-billing-for-github-packages)

To promote "public" GitHub repositories, yet remove antiquated repositories,

1. All active repositories are "public".
1. Antiquated repositories are marked as publicly
   [deprecated](../../HOWTO/deprecate-a-github-repository.md).
1. After a GitHub repository has been publicly deprecated for over 1 year
   it may become "private".
1. The schedule for making deprecated repositories "private" is at
   [deprecated-repositories.md](../../lists/deprecated-repositories.md)
