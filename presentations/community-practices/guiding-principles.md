# Guiding principles

What is the "North Star" for the Senzing Community?

## Goals

1. Help Senzing customers evaluate and deploy Senzing quicker
1. Create "helpers" that accelerate Senzing deployment
    1. Code examples
    1. Programs for helping with common tasks
    1. Reference architectures
1. Have software community recognize Senzing as a company that "does it right".

## Approaches

1. Design for customer infrastructures.
   Examples:
    1. Demonstration systems - for customer evaluation
    1. "Bare-metal" systems  (e.g. Linux/Debian/RedHat, Windows, MacOS, etc.)
    1. Cloud systems (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, etc.)
    1. Air-gapped systems
    1. [The Twelve-factor App](../../WHATIS/twelve-factor-app.md)
    1. [cattle vs. pets](../../WHATIS/cattle-vs-pets.md)
    1. Log analysis - (e.g. ELK stacks, Datadog, Splunk, etc)
1. Use standards.
   Examples:
    1. [Semantic versioning](../../WHATIS/semantic-versioning.md)
    1. [Linux Hierarchical File standard](../../WHATIS/linux-filesystem-hierarchy-standard.md)
    1. [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339) - timestamps
1. Use current software methodologies.
   Examples:
    1. [GitHub Flow](../../WHATIS/github-flow.md)
    1. [Kanban](../../WHATIS/kanban.md)

## Standard practices

By using standard practices, as Senzing grows, we look for professionals familiar with "standard practices"
so they don't have to learn "one-off" methods.
So instead of
> This is how it's done at Senzing.

it should be

> This is how it ought to be done everywhere.
