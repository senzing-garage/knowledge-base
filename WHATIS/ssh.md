# What is ssh

> Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network 
> services securely over an unsecured network.[1] Typical applications include 
> remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service 
> can be secured with SSH.SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network 
> by using a client–server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with 
> an SSH server.[2] The protocol specification distinguishes between two major 
> versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The standard TCP port for SSH is 22. SSH 
>is generally used to access Unix-like operating systems, but it can also be used 
> on Microsoft Windows. Windows 10 uses OpenSSH as its default SSH client and SSH server.[3]
