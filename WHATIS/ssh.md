# What is ssh

> Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network
> services securely over an unsecured network.[1] Typical applications include
> remote command-line, login, and remote command execution, but any network service
> can be secured with SSH.SSH provides a secure channel over an unsecured network
> by using a clientâ€“server architecture, connecting an SSH client application with
> an SSH server.[2] The protocol specification distinguishes between two major
> versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The standard TCP port for SSH is 22. SSH
> is generally used to access Unix-like operating systems, but it can also be used
> on Microsoft Windows. Windows 10 uses OpenSSH as its default SSH client and SSH server.[3]
