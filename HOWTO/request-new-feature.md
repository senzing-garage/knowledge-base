# How to request new feature

If a new feature either:

1. Requires one or more new repositories
1. Affects more than one existing repository

the request is tracked by the [Community Roadmap](https://github.com/Senzing/community-roadmap).
However, if a new feature request is for a specific repository, see
[request new feature in existing repository](request-new-feature-in-existing-repository.md).

If a new feature has already been
[requested](https://github.com/Senzing/community-roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aissue+),
feel free to add a comment to the issue
or add a "thumbs up" to help Senzing assess priority of new feature requests.
If a request doesn't already exist, open a new
[feature request](https://github.com/Senzing/community-roadmap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md).
