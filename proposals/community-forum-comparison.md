### The question: are we looking for public support or community engagement?

I think we're looking for something like the [Apple support community](https://discussions.apple.com)

## Zendesk Gather, community forums

[Zendesk Gather help center](https://www.zendesk.com/service/help-center/community-software/)

- :heavy_check_mark: Can convert posts to tickets

We already use [Zendesk Guide](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204231676) for self serve knowledge base

## GitHub discussions

[GitHub discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions)

- [Follow Google Android model and use a Senzing tag?](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2009/12/hello-stack-overflow.html)

Private stackoverflow? with [Stackoverflow teams](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/16054/is-stack-exchange-stack-overflow-available-for-private-or-internal-use)

- Stackoverflow teams. It is private, but itegrates with regular stack overflow
- New [Stackexchange](https://area51.stackexchange.com)? probably not.

- notifications is a user setting but with admin defaults

## Sub-Reddit?

Back to the question are we looking for public support or community engagement?

# If we're looking to build a community, Learn from those who do it all the time:

"...a standalone site needs about 500 total users. Fewer than that and thereâ€™s just not enough activity to keep people regularly engaged."
[Jon Ericson](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/05/23/how-stack-overflow-for-teams-fits-into-the-community/)
